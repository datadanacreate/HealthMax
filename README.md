# HealthMax Excel Project

**HealthMax** is a fictitious market leader in the shampoo industry. In this project, I analyzed their data to identify growth opportunities related to **Net Revenue Management (NRM)** and generated actionable insights to help grow the business.

---

## Year Over Year Growth

I began by calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **market share** and **value growth** across various time dimensions, including:

- **Year-to-Date (YTD)**
- **Moving Annual Total (MAT)**

---

## Year to Date (YTD)

- The dataset includes unit and value sales per month from **2018 to 2023**.
- Used the `SUMIFS()` function in Excel to calculate YTD values across all data points and time periods.

---

## Moving Annual Total (MAT)

- Calculated MAT values over longer periods than YTD to understand trends and performance over rolling 12-month windows.

---

## Market Share

- Created PivotTables to calculate total value sales by **year** and **brand**.
- Built a dedicated worksheet named **"Market Share"** to track brand evolution and explore regional differences.

# Net Revenue Management (NRM)

Focused on two key pillars of NRM:

1. **Brand Portfolio Pricing**
2. **Mix Management**

Performed the following analyses:

- Calculated KPIs such as **net sales contribution** and **gross margin**.
- Used brand portfolio pricing to determine optimal pricing for consumers.
- Applied mix management techniques to support launching a new product and expanding into a new shampoo subcategory.

---

## Profitability Matrix

- Compiled product prioritization based on **net sales** and **profitability**.
- Calculated net sales for each product to guide investment shifts.

---

## Gross Margin Analysis

- Created a scatter plot comparing **gross margin** versus **net sales contribution** for all products.

---

## New Category Opportunity

- Identified that HealthMax operates in only 2 of 5 shampoo subcategories.
- Targeted the fastest growing subcategory: **Organic shampoos**.
- Estimated the 2024 Organic subcategory size to be **20% higher** than the March 2023 MAT.
- Projected total units sold in 2024: **1,020,899** units.

---

## New Product Launch

- Evaluated two potential products for the Organic shampoo category launch in early 2024.
- Estimated expected **net sales**, **gross profit**, and **gross margin** for each candidate.
- Selected the best product based on these financial projections.

# Optimizing Net Revenue

## Price Pack Architecture

- The smallest current size is **100ml**.
- Market research indicated demand for **50ml** travel-sized bottles.
- Proposed launching the **Starburst Ultra Soft 50ml** as a smaller pack.

**Assumptions:**

- 50ml volume = 10% of the 100ml pack volume (2022)
- Retail price is a 50% markup on price per ml of 100ml pack
- Net Price: $2.30; Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $0.70

**Result:**  
The new 50ml pack is expected to generate **$365,960** in net sales.

---

## Promotion Management

- Analyzed three different promotions for the **Shinez** brand in 2022.
- Calculated ROI for each to identify the most effective promotional strategies for 2024.

---

## Forecasting

- Used Excel’s **Forecast Sheet** function to predict full-year sales for **2023 and 2024**.

---

## Waterfall Chart

- Created a waterfall chart illustrating how the NRM initiatives impact 2024 net sales compared to natural growth.
- Combined sales estimates from:
  - Organic shampoo launch (product 2)
  - 50ml shampoo launch
  - Other initiatives
- Total 2024 sales projection: **$21,411,568.78**

*Note:* Assumes growth initiatives do not cannibalize each other.

---

## Conclusion

- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the shampoo category.
- Calculated crucial KPIs including growth, market share, YTD, and MAT.
- Forecasted net sales for upcoming years.
- Demonstrated that NRM initiatives can unlock additional growth potential.
- Provided strategic recommendations to increase HealthMax’s net sales and profitability.
